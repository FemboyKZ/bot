# fkz dc bot

Really shitty Discord bot with a random assortment of features.

I don't recommend running this for yourself.

You can contact me and see the bot in action on the [FKZ Discord](https://discord.gg/fkz)

## info

This repo exists just for me to store this on cloud and manage versions and track issues.
If you wish to help with this feel free to open prs.

## usage

- run `npm install` to install dependencies
- create and fill out a `.env` file with details shown on the `.example`
- open a terminal and execute `node .` to start the bot
